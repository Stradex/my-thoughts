# Welcome to my blog

Hi everyone, this is Stradex. It's been a long while since I wanted to start making my own blog but every single time I wanted to start with this, I failed to do it because I was never able to find the proper medium to share my thoughts quickly and in a comfortable way to me. 

I tend to spend LOT of time in the command line and I usually don't like to log in any website or to even open the web browser, and because of that many of the traditional mediums to share my thoughts in internet were not for me. I always liked to talk, share ideas or just rant about random stuff haha, but I was never able to find my proper... let's call it workflow.

I tried once with Next.JS and Github Actions but for the sake of easy deployment I decided to go with Hugo and Github Actions, since it offers a really easy and comfortable workflow for me to blog that does not require me to spend lot of time with distractions that are aside from blogging. I like challenges and spending time with open source projects but when I want to write and share an idea, I want it to be as easy as writing something in a personal notebook with a pen in my house.

## What to expect here?

Well, I tend to like LOT of things: Ancient History, Mathematics, Philosophy, Game development, Programming, DevOps and Music. 
It seems it may not be a lot of things, but you get an idea that I like many things so I have lot of things to share, discuss and learn.
